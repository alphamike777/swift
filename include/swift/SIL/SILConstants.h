    // mutated by taking the address of the internal storage i.e., through a
    // shared, mutable pointer to the internal storage of the array. In fact,
    // this is how an array initialization is lowered in SIL. Therefore, the
    // symbolic representation of an array is an addressable "memory cell"
    // (i.e., a SymbolicValueMemoryObject) containing the array storage. The
    // array storage is modeled by the type: SymbolicArrayStorage. This
    // representation of the array enables obtaining the address of the internal
    // storage and modifying the array through that address. Array operations
    // such as `append` that mutate an array must clone the internal storage of
    // the array, following the semantics of the Swift implementation of those
    // operations.
